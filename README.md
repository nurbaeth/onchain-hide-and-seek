🕵️‍♀️ onchain-hide-and-seek      
A fully on-chain "Hide and Seek" game written in Solidity.      
One player hides in a secret spot, and another tries to find them.   
No tokens. No rewards. Just pure game logic on the blockchain.      
       
🎮 Game Flow     
Hider calls hide(spot) to choose a secret location (1–5).   
      
Seeker calls seek(guess) to try to find the hider.  
    
The game ends and the contract reveals the result.    
     
Anyone can call resetGame() to start over.  
        
✨ Features
🧠 100% logic-based — no randomness, no dependencies.
   
⚙️ Stateless rounds — simple hide/seek/reset loop. 

🛡️ Prevents the same player from hiding and seeking.
    
🔒 Secret spot is stored privately (but visible on-chain for advanced seekers).
