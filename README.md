🕵️‍♀️ onchain-hide-and-seek               
A fully on-chain "Hide and Seek" game written in Solidity.              
One player hides in a secret spot, and another tries to find them.           
No tokens. No rewards. Just pure game logic on the blockchain.             
              
🎮 Game Flow           
Hider calls hide(spot) to choose a secret location (1–5).        
            
Seeker calls seek(guess) to try to find the hider.     
        
The game ends and the contract reveals the result.        
        
Anyone can call resetGame() to start over.     
           
✨ Features    
🧠 100% logic-based — no randomness, no dependencies.    
        
⚙️ Stateless rounds — simple hide/seek/reset loop.    
      
🛡️ Prevents the same player from hiding and seeking.    
         
🔒 Secret spot is stored privately (but visible on-chain for advanced seekers).
